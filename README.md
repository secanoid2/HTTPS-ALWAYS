## Temporarily Disabling the Extension

If you ever need to temporarily allow a network request through as HTTP, you can disable the HTTPS Always Extension for a specific browsing session. Follow these steps:

1. **Access Chrome Extensions:**
   - Click on the puzzle icon in the Chrome toolbar.
   - Select "Manage extensions."

2. **Disable HTTPS Always:**
   - Locate the HTTPS Always Extension in the extensions list.
   - Toggle the switch next to "HTTPS Always" to disable the extension temporarily.

3. **Allow HTTP Requests:**
   - Perform your necessary tasks that require HTTP connections.
   - Keep in mind that once you close the browser or start a new session, the extension will be re-enabled.

4. **Re-enable the Extension:**
   - To re-enable the extension, follow the same steps but toggle the switch back to the enabled position.

Note: Disabling the extension temporarily reduces the security benefits it provides. Exercise caution and re-enable the extension promptly after completing your tasks.
